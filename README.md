# node-red-contrib-tcc-honeywell
Honeywell Legacy Thermostats Node for Node-Red

Pulls data from the Honeywell TCC (Total Connect Comfort) API, which appears to be mostly undocumented now.

*Still under development.*

So far it is just reading the status from the API. Still need to add the ability to send data. Interaction will probably be limited to turning the termostat on and off, setting a hold temperature, changing the running mode (heat, cool, etc.), etc.
